# Windows Qwen4Exp / Strix Halo

This branch is a Windows HIP build of the ROCmFPX fork with the Qwen4Exp
architecture, embedded MTP support, and a Windows mmap-backed PLE pager.
It targets AMD Strix Halo / `gfx1151` and the ROCmFP4 Qwen3.8 Flash-Next GGUF.

## Build

Use a Visual Studio Developer PowerShell with the Windows SDK, CMake, and a
ROCm installation that provides HIP for the target device:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DGPU_TARGETS=gfx1151 -DGGML_NATIVE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target llama-server llama-fit-params llama-bench -j 4
```

The resulting executables are under `build/bin/`.

## Runtime profile

For the Qwen3.8 Flash-Next ROCmFP4 STRIX model, the tested profile is:

```text
--ctx-size 262144 --spec-type draft-mtp --flash-attn on --spec-draft-n-max 3
--fit off --spec-draft-model C:\models\MTP\Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-MTP-Q8_0.gguf
--ctx-checkpoints 32 --batch-size 2048 --ubatch-size 512 --parallel 1
--no-webui --cache-ram 0 --mmap --tensor-read-lazy on
```

Use `--device ROCm0` when selecting a device explicitly. `--tensor-read-lazy`
requires `--mmap` and activates the mmap-backed PLE path in this branch.

## Windows memory behavior

`--tensor-read-lazy on` delays tensor access and avoids eagerly prefetching the
large PLE tensor. Both direct and mmap pager modes exclude the PLE file range
from initial prefetch while retaining normal prefetch for the other weights.
The loader no longer calls the process-wide `EmptyWorkingSet`, which could evict
freshly warmed zero-copy weights and unrelated hot pages. Windows can still
retain file-mapped pages in the process working set or standby cache after they
are touched.

If a persistent hard working-set ceiling is required after measurement, apply
the optional helper after the server is healthy:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\set-windows-working-set.ps1 -Port 8080 -MaxGiB 8
```

The hard limit is per process and must be applied again after a server restart.
It reduces resident process pages; it does not reduce committed GPU/UMA memory
and does not provide a strict SSD-only guarantee. A lower limit can increase PLE
page faults and reduce prompt-processing speed.

The direct-PLE smoke test records working set by default. Pass
`-ApplyWorkingSetCap -MaxWorkingSetGiB 6` when the test should explicitly apply
and validate the optional 6 GiB process cap.

## Scope and limitations

- This is a hardware- and driver-specific experimental build for Windows HIP /
  `gfx1151`.
- The embedded MTP path is intended for text generation. Keep vision disabled
  unless the multimodal path has been tested separately with the exact build.
- The repository does not contain model files, MTP files, ROCm DLLs, or local
  benchmark logs. Supply those separately.
